                   description="Phone/contact number")
@validator('phone')

## Validation Rules

### Frontend Validation
- **Full Name:** Minimum 3 characters, letters only
- **Email:** Valid email format
- **Phone:** 10 digits, Indian format (starts with 6-9)
- **Registration Number:** Alphanumeric, minimum 5 characters
- **State:** Must select from dropdown (Indian states)

### Backend Validation
- **Phone:** Accepts 10-digit or 12-digit (with +91) Indian numbers
- **Phone:** Auto-normalizes to 10 digits without country code
- **Phone:** Must start with 6, 7, 8, or 9
- All other validations remain the same

## New Registration Flow

### Step 1: Doctor Signs Up
1. Doctor visits `/register` page
2. Fills out form WITHOUT password
3. Submits application
4. Receives confirmation: "Application submitted for review"

### Step 2: Admin Reviews
1. Admin logs into admin dashboard
2. Reviews pending applications
3. Verifies medical credentials
4. **Clicks "Approve"** (this is when magic happens)

### Step 3: System Generates Password
1. System generates secure temporary password
2. System updates user record:
   - Sets `is_active = True`
   - Sets `doctor_status = 'verified'`
   - Sets `password_reset_required = True`
3. System sends email with:
   - Temporary password
   - Login instructions
   - Link to login page

### Step 4: Doctor Logs In
1. Doctor receives email with credentials
2. Logs in with temporary password
3. System detects `password_reset_required = True`
4. **Redirects to `/auth/reset-password`** (forced)
5. Doctor sets permanent password
6. Redirect to profile completion or dashboard

## Important Notes

### Security Considerations
1. **Placeholder Password:** During registration, a secure random password is generated and stored. This ensures the user record is valid but unusable until admin approval.

2. **Temporary Password Generation:** When admin approves, a NEW temporary password should be generated (not the placeholder). This needs to be implemented in the admin approval flow.

3. **Password Reset Required:** The `password_reset_required` flag ensures doctors MUST set a new password on first login.

### Breaking Changes
‚ö†Ô∏è **BREAKING CHANGE:** This update changes the API contract for `/api/v1/doctor/register`

**Old Request:**
```json
{
  "fullName": "Dr. John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "medicalRegistrationNumber": "12345/A/2020",
  "stateMedicalCouncil": "Maharashtra"
}
```

**New Request:**
```json
{
  "fullName": "Dr. John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "medicalRegistrationNumber": "12345/A/2020",
  "stateMedicalCouncil": "Maharashtra"
}
```

### Next Steps - Admin Approval Flow

The following functionality still needs to be implemented in the **admin approval endpoint**:

1. **Generate Temporary Password:**
   ```python
   import secrets
   import string
   
   def generate_temp_password(length=12):
       alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "!@#$%"
       return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(length))
   ```

2. **Update User on Approval:**
   ```python
   temp_password = generate_temp_password()
   user.password_hash = hash_password(temp_password)
   user.password_reset_required = True
   user.is_active = True
   user.doctor_status = "verified"
   ```

3. **Send Email with Credentials:**
   - Template: "doctor_approval_with_credentials"
   - Include: `temp_password`, `login_link`, `full_name`

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Clearer Process:** The new informational banner makes it crystal clear what will happen
2. **Less Friction:** No password field means faster registration
3. **Better Security:** Admin-generated passwords are more secure than user-chosen ones
4. **Professional Flow:** Mirrors enterprise SaaS onboarding processes
5. **Mobile-Friendly:** Form is shorter and easier to complete on mobile

## Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

All frontend changes are complete and tested. Backend changes are complete and ready.

**Remaining Work:**
- Implement temporary password generation in admin approval flow
- Update email template for approval with credentials
- Test complete end-to-end flow

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the implementation, check:
1. Browser console for frontend errors
2. Backend logs for API errors
3. Email queue for delivery issues
4. Database for phone number storage
