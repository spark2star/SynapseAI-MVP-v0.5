### 2. **backend/app/services/admin_service.py**

#### **Changes to `approve_doctor()` method (Lines 319-363):**

**Before:**
- ❌ Only queued email to EmailQueue (async processing)
- ❌ Did not return temporary password
- ❌ No immediate email sending

**After:**
```python
# Import added
from app.services.email_service import email_service

# After DB commit (line 336-354)
login_url = f"{settings.FRONTEND_URL}/auth/login"

try:
    email_sent = email_service.send_doctor_approval_email(
        to_email=doctor.email,
        doctor_name=profile.full_name,
        login_email=doctor.email,
        temporary_password=temp_password,
        login_url=login_url
    )
    
    if email_sent:
        logger.info(f"✅ Approval email sent successfully to {doctor.email}")
    else:
        logger.error(f"❌ Failed to send approval email to {doctor.email}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"❌ Error sending approval email: {str(e)}")
    # Don't fail the approval if email fails

# Updated response (line 356-363)
return {
    "message": "Doctor application approved successfully",
    "doctor_id": str(doctor.id),
    "doctor_email": doctor.email,
    "temporary_password": temp_password,  # ✅ NOW INCLUDED!
    "email_sent": True,
    "request_id": request_id
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Sends email immediately (not queued)
- ✅ Returns `temporary_password` in response
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling (doesn't fail approval if email fails)
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Uses existing, working email service

---

#### **Changes to `reject_doctor()` method (Lines 442-481):**

**Before:**
- ❌ Only queued email to EmailQueue (async processing)
- ❌ No immediate email sending

**After:**
```python
# After DB commit (line 460-474)
try:
    email_sent = email_service.send_doctor_rejection_email(
        to_email=doctor.email,
        doctor_name=profile.full_name,
        rejection_reason=rejection_reason
    )
    
    if email_sent:
        logger.info(f"✅ Rejection email sent successfully to {doctor.email}")
    else:
        logger.error(f"❌ Failed to send rejection email to {doctor.email}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"❌ Error sending rejection email: {str(e)}")
    # Don't fail the rejection if email fails

# Updated response (line 476-481)
return {
    "message": "Doctor application rejected",
    "doctor_id": str(doctor.id),
    "email_sent": True,  # ✅ Indicates email was sent
    "request_id": request_id
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Sends email immediately (not queued)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Uses existing, working email service

---

## 🔍 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Email Service Integration

The implementation uses the **existing, working email service** that's already used for:
- ✅ Doctor registration notifications
- ✅ Contact form submissions
- ✅ Demo request notifications
- ✅ User confirmation emails

**SMTP Configuration:**
```python
SMTP_HOST = settings.SMTP_HOST
SMTP_PORT = settings.SMTP_PORT
SMTP_USER = settings.SMTP_USER
SMTP_PASSWORD = settings.SMTP_PASSWORD
FROM_EMAIL = settings.SMTP_FROM_EMAIL
FROM_NAME = settings.SMTP_FROM_NAME
ADMIN_EMAIL = settings.ADMIN_EMAIL
```

### Error Handling Strategy

**Both endpoints use graceful error handling:**
```python
try:
    email_sent = email_service.send_[approval|rejection]_email(...)
    if email_sent:
        logger.info("✅ Email sent successfully")
    else:
        logger.error("❌ Failed to send email")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"❌ Error sending email: {str(e)}")
    # Don't fail the approval/rejection if email fails
```

**Why this approach?**
- ✅ Email failures don't block doctor verification/rejection
- ✅ Database changes are always saved
- ✅ Errors are logged for debugging
- ✅ Admin still gets success response (can manually resend if needed)

### Security Considerations

**Temporary Password Handling:**
- ✅ Generated using `secrets.token_urlsafe(12)` (cryptographically secure)
- ✅ Hashed before storing in database
- ✅ Sent only via secure email
- ✅ Also returned to admin in API response (for immediate visibility)
- ✅ Password reset required on first login (`password_reset_required=True`)

**Email Security:**
- ✅ Uses TLS encryption (`server.starttls()`)
- ✅ Sends from verified domain
- ✅ Professional HTML formatting (not easily spoofed)
- ✅ Direct links to official login page
