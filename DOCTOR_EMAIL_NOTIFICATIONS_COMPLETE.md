## 🔧 **What Was Changed**

### **1. Email Service** (`backend/app/services/email_service.py`)

Added two new methods:

```python
def send_doctor_registration_notification(doctor_data)
  # Sends beautiful HTML email to admin with all doctor details
  # Includes "PENDING VERIFICATION" status badge
  # Shows next steps for verification

def send_doctor_registration_confirmation(email, name)
  # Sends welcome email to doctor
  # Explains what happens next
  # Sets expectations (2-3 business days)
```

### **2. Auth Service** (`backend/app/services/auth_service.py`)

Updated `register_doctor()` method:
- After successful database commit
- Sends admin notification email
- Sends doctor confirmation email
- **Gracefully handles email failures** (registration still succeeds)
- Detailed logging for debugging

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

# Terminal 1: Start backend
