/*
 * Placeholder for RNNoise WebAssembly binary
 * 
 * This is a placeholder file. In a production environment, you would either:
 * 1. Build RNNoise from source to WebAssembly
 * 2. Use a pre-built RNNoise WASM binary
 * 3. Use the mock implementation in rnnoise.js for development
 * 
 * For now, the JavaScript implementation will provide a mock noise reduction
 * that still improves audio quality through basic filtering.
 * 
 * To get the real RNNoise WASM binary:
 * - Clone https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise
 * - Follow the WebAssembly build instructions
 * - Replace this file with the generated rnnoise.wasm
