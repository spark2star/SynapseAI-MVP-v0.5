## 🔧 **DETAILED FIXES**

### **1. ✅ Authentication Token Fixed**

**Problem:**  
- Console error: `[VertexAI] No access token found`
- Connection status showed "Disconnected" immediately
- WebSocket failed to connect

**Root Cause:**  
Component was looking for `localStorage.getItem('accessToken')` but the actual key is `access_token` (with underscore).

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Before:
const token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken')  // ❌ Wrong key

// After:
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token')  // ✅ Correct key
```

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/VertexAIAudioRecorder.tsx`

**Result:**  
- ✅ WebSocket connects successfully
- ✅ Status shows "🟢 Connected" 
- ✅ Authentication works

---

### **2. ✅ Pause/Stop/Resume Buttons Added**

**Problem:**  
- No visible control buttons during recording
- Couldn't pause or stop from UI
- Had to refresh page to stop

**Solution:**  
Added complete control button set with state management:

```typescript
{isRecording ? (
    <>
        {!isPaused ? (
            <>
                <button onClick={onPause}>⏸️ Pause</button>
                <button onClick={stopRecording}>⏹️ Stop</button>
            </>
        ) : (
            <button onClick={onResume}>▶️ Resume</button>
        )}
    </>
) : (
    <div>Auto-detection info message</div>
)}
```

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/VertexAIAudioRecorder.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ **Pause button** - Yellow, pauses recording
- ✅ **Stop button** - Red, stops and closes connection
- ✅ **Resume button** - Green, resumes after pause
- ✅ State-aware UI (shows/hides based on recording state)

---

### **3. ✅ Volume Bar Size Reduced**

**Problem:**  
- Volume bar was too large and took up too much space
- Text sizing was inconsistent

**Solution:**

```css
/* Before */
h-2        /* Height: 8px */
text-sm    /* Font size: 14px */
space-y-3  /* Spacing: 12px */

/* After */
h-1.5      /* Height: 6px - 25% smaller */
text-xs    /* Font size: 12px - more compact */
space-y-2  /* Spacing: 8px - tighter */
```

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/VertexAIAudioRecorder.tsx`

**Result:**  
- ✅ Compact, professional appearance
- ✅ Consistent text sizing
- ✅ More screen space for transcription

---

### **4. ✅ Language Selector Removed**

**Problem:**  
- Manual language selection was unnecessary
- Vertex AI auto-detects language anyway
- Extra step before starting consultation

**Solution:**  
- Removed entire language selection UI
- Replaced with informative message about auto-detection
- Removed `selectedLanguage` state/props

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/app/dashboard/patients/[id]/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/consultation/VertexAIAudioRecorder.tsx`

**UI Change:**

**Before:**
```
🔘 Hindi (हिंदी)   🔘 Marathi (मराठी)   🔘 English (India)
[Select your language before starting]
```

**After:**
```
✨ Automatically detects and switches between Hindi (हिंदी), 
   Marathi (मराठी), and English (India). Just speak naturally!
```

---

### **5. ✅ STT Timeout Fixed (45-second issue)**

**Problem:**  
- Transcription would stop after ~40-45 seconds
- No error messages shown
- Audio still recording but no text generated

**Root Cause:**  
WebSocket timeout in audio stream generator was set to 30 seconds.

**Solution:**

```python
# backend/app/api/websocket/transcribe.py

# Before:
audio_chunk = await asyncio.wait_for(
    websocket.receive_bytes(),
    timeout=30.0  # ❌ Too short for consultations
)

# After:
audio_chunk = await asyncio.wait_for(
    websocket.receive_bytes(),
    timeout=300.0  # ✅ 5 minutes for long sessions
)
```

**Result:**  
- ✅ Supports consultations up to 5 minutes
- ✅ No more unexpected timeouts
- ✅ Stable connection throughout session

---

### **6. ✅ Speaker Diarization Disabled**

**Problem:**  
- Speaker diarization was enabled but not needed
- Only doctor's voice matters for documentation
- Added unnecessary processing overhead

**Solution:**

```python
# backend/app/core/config.py

# Before:
GOOGLE_STT_ENABLE_DIARIZATION: bool = True
GOOGLE_STT_DIARIZATION_SPEAKER_COUNT: int = 2  # Doctor + Patient

# After:
GOOGLE_STT_ENABLE_DIARIZATION: bool = False  # Doctor-only
GOOGLE_STT_DIARIZATION_SPEAKER_COUNT: int = 1  # Single speaker
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Faster transcription processing
- ✅ Lower API costs
- ✅ Simpler output (no speaker tags)
- ✅ Focus on doctor's dictation

---

### **7. ✅ "Recognition Already Started" Error Fixed**

**Problem:**  
```
Error: Failed to execute 'start' on 'SpeechRecognition': 
recognition has already started
```
- Happened on pause/resume
- Race conditions in old browser API

**Solution:**  
Created new `VertexAIAudioRecorder` component that uses WebSocket instead of browser SpeechRecognition API.

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Clean connection lifecycle management
- ✅ Proper cleanup on unmount
- ✅ No race conditions
- ✅ Production-grade error handling

**File Created:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/VertexAIAudioRecorder.tsx` (520 lines)
