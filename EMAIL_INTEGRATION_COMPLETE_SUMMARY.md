## 🚀 **TEST NOW (Step-by-Step)**

### **Step 1: Test Email Endpoint (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000 --log-level info

# Terminal 2: Test endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/forms/test-email
```

**Expected:**
- Backend logs show detailed email sending process
- Response shows `"status": "success"`
- Email arrives at mohdanees1717@gmail.com

**If this works → Email service is fully integrated! ✅**

### **Step 2: Test Demo Request via API (2 minutes)**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/forms/demo-requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "full_name": "API Test",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "phone": "+91 9876543210"
  }'
```

**Expected backend logs:**
```
📋 NEW DEMO REQUEST RECEIVED
💾 Step 1: Saving to database...
✅ Saved to database
📧 Step 2: Preparing admin notification email...
✅ EMAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY TO mohdanees1717@gmail.com
✅ Admin notification sent successfully
📧 Step 3: Sending user confirmation...
✅ EMAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY
✅ DEMO REQUEST PROCESSED SUCCESSFULLY
```

**If this works → API integration complete! ✅**

---

### **Step 3: Test Frontend Form (3 minutes)**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend (already running)
# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Browser: http://localhost:3000/demo
# Fill out and submit form
# Watch backend logs in Terminal 1
```

**Expected:**
- Form submits successfully

## 🔍 **Debugging Flow**

### **If Email Endpoint Test Fails:**

1. **Check backend logs** for specific error
2. **Run:** `cd backend && python test_email_direct.py`
3. **Verify:** Gmail app password is correct
4. **See:** `EMAIL_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`

---

### **If Demo Request Test Fails:**

1. **Check if endpoint exists:** http://localhost:8000/docs
2. **Look for:** `POST /api/v1/forms/demo-requests`
3. **Check backend logs** for errors
4. **Verify:** Database migration ran (`alembic upgrade head`)

---

### **If Frontend Form Fails:**

1. **Open browser Console (F12)**
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Submit form and check:**
   - Is request being made?
   - What's the status code?
   - Any errors in console?
4. **Check:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts` baseURL
5. **Verify:** CORS configured in backend
