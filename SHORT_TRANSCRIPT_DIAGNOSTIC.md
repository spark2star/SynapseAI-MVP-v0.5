# üîç Short Transcript Diagnostic Analysis

**Session:** CS-20251015-20EB697B  
**Issue:** Only 2 words captured ("‡§°‡•â ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§¨" = 7 chars) from 30 seconds of audio

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### AudioWorklet: Perfect! ‚úÖ
```
‚úÖ AudioWorklet module loaded successfully
‚úÖ AudioWorkletNode started @ 16kHz (modern, reliable API)
‚úÖ AudioWorklet: 6252 chunks processed (50.0s of audio)
```
**Audio collection is working perfectly!**

### Audio Quality: Good! ‚úÖ
```
max=25609, avg=1083
Size: 938.04 KB
Duration: 30.02s
Samples: 480256
```
**Audio is being captured with good quality!**

### Backend Communication: Working! ‚úÖ
```
Status: success
Confidence: 0.89 (89%)
Language: hi-IN (Hindi)
```
**Backend is responding and detecting Hindi correctly!**

---

## ‚ùå The Problem

### Expected:
From 30 seconds of continuous Hindi speech, expect **200-300+ characters**

### Actual:
Only **7 characters**: "‡§°‡•â ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§¨"

### This Means:
Google Speech API **received** the audio (no errors) but only **recognized** 2 words. This is a **speech recognition issue**, not an audio capture issue.

---

## üîç Possible Causes

### 1. Audio Amplitude Too Low
**Evidence:**
- avg=1083 (moderate, not great)
- Previous test: avg=918 and avg=66
- Current test: avg=1083

**Analysis:**
Average amplitude of 1083 is quite low. For good STT results, you want:
- avg > 5000 for clear speech
- avg > 10000 for excellent results
- avg ~1000 is very quiet

**Recommendation:** Speak **much louder** or move microphone closer

### 2. Background Noise
**Check:**
- Are you in a quiet environment?
- Is there AC, fan, or computer noise?
- Is the microphone picking up ambient sound?

### 3. Microphone Quality
**Check:**
- Built-in laptop mic vs external mic
- Microphone too far from mouth
- Mic not facing speaker

### 4. Speech Clarity
**Check:**
- Speaking clearly and distinctly?
- Normal conversational pace?
- Pronunciation clear?

### 5. Google Speech API Confidence
**Current:** 0.89 (89%)

This is good confidence, but Google only recognized 2 words. This suggests:
- The words it recognized, it's confident about
- But it couldn't recognize the rest of the audio

## üß™ Diagnostic Tests

### Test 1: Volume Check
**Try this:**
1. Start recording
2. **Speak VERY LOUDLY** (almost shouting)
3. **Move microphone 6 inches from mouth**
4. Say clearly: "‡§°‡•â‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§¨, ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à"
5. Check if more words captured

**Target:** avg amplitude > 5000

### Test 2: English Test
**Try this:**
1. Start recording
2. **Select English language**
3. Speak clearly in English: "Doctor, I have been feeling very anxious for three weeks"
4. Check if full sentence captured

**This tests:** If issue is Hindi-specific or general

### Test 3: Check Backend Logs
**Look for these in your backend terminal:**

```bash
# Search for this session
grep "20EB697B" backend_logs.txt

# Look for:
üìä [STT] Got X results from Speech API  # ‚Üê How many results?
Result 1: '...'  # ‚Üê What did Google actually return?
‚ö†Ô∏è [STT] No results from Speech API  # ‚Üê Or did it get nothing?
```

**Questions to answer:**
- Did Google Speech API return multiple results?
- Did backend only extract 2 words from a longer response?
- Or did Google only recognize 2 words?

## üîä Audio Amplitude Guidelines

| Amplitude (avg) | Quality | STT Accuracy | Action |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|--------|
| > 10,000 | Excellent | 90%+ | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| 5,000 - 10,000 | Good | 80-90% | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| 2,000 - 5,000 | Moderate | 60-80% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Increase volume |
| 1,000 - 2,000 | Low | 40-60% | ‚ùå **Speak louder!** |
| < 1,000 | Very Low | < 40% | ‚ùå **Too quiet!** |

**Your current:** avg=1083 ‚Üí **Low quality zone**

**Action Required:** Speak **much louder** or move mic closer!

## üí° Immediate Fix Recommendations

### Option 1: Increase Microphone Volume (OS Level)
**Mac:**
1. System Preferences ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Input
2. Select your microphone
3. Drag "Input volume" slider to maximum
4. Test by speaking - bars should fill up

**Windows:**
1. Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Input
2. Select microphone
3. Increase input volume to 80-100%

### Option 2: Microphone Position
- **Distance:** 4-6 inches from mouth
- **Angle:** Point directly at mouth
- **Test:** Tap microphone, should hear loud tapping sound

### Option 3: Software Gain (Already Applied)
Backend is applying 1.09x gain:
```
normalized_max_amplitude: 27851
gain_factor: 1.09
```

But starting amplitude is too low for gain to help much.

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Check backend terminal** for full Google Speech API response
   - Look for session CS-20251015-20EB697B
   - Find "Step 7" logs showing what Google returned
   - Copy here for analysis

2. **Increase microphone volume** to maximum in System Preferences

3. **Test with very loud speech:**
   ```
   ‡§°‡•â‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§¨! [PAUSE] ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á! [PAUSE] ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§! [PAUSE] ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§æ! [PAUSE] ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à!
   ```
   Speak each word LOUDLY with pauses

4. **Check audio amplitude** in console:
   - Target: avg > 5000
   - Current: avg=1083 (too low!)

### Questions for Backend Logs:

1. How many results did Google Speech API return?
   ```
   üìä [STT] Got X results from Speech API
   ```

2. What did each result contain?
   ```
   Result 1: '...' (confidence: ...)
   Result 2: '...' (confidence: ...)
   ```

3. Were there any warnings or errors?
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è [STT] ...
   ‚ùå [STT] ...
   ```

## üî¨ Technical Analysis

### Data Points:
- ‚úÖ Audio captured: 30.02s (480,256 samples)
- ‚úÖ Audio sent: 938 KB
- ‚úÖ Backend received: success
- ‚úÖ Google API called: success
- ‚úÖ Language detected: hi-IN
- ‚úÖ Confidence: 0.89
- ‚ùå Transcript length: 7 chars (should be 200-300)

### Hypothesis:
**Audio is too quiet for Google Speech API to recognize clearly**

Even though amplitude=1083 passes VAD checks, it may be too low for accurate STT:
- VAD threshold: avg > 50 (just checks for presence of sound)
- STT optimal: avg > 5000 (needs clear, loud speech)

### Evidence:
- Gain was applied: 1.09x boost
- After gain: avg=1177 (still low!)
- Google only recognized loudest/clearest 2 words

## üìã Diagnostic Checklist

**Please check backend terminal for:**
- [ ] Full STT logs for session CS-20251015-20EB697B
- [ ] How many results Google Speech API returned
- [ ] What the full Google response contained
- [ ] Any errors or warnings during transcription

**Please check audio setup:**
- [ ] Microphone volume at maximum in System Preferences
- [ ] Microphone 4-6 inches from mouth
- [ ] Speaking loudly (not normal volume, LOUD)
- [ ] Quiet environment (no background noise)
- [ ] Built-in mic vs external mic

**Please test:**

- [ ] Checking if avg amplitude increases to > 5000
- [ ] Testing with English to rule out language-specific issues
