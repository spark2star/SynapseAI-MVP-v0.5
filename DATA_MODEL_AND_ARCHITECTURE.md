## 5. Data Privacy & Security

### 5.1 Encryption Strategy

**All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is encrypted at rest:**

**Encrypted Fields:**
- Patient: Name, DOB, contact info, address, medical history, insurance
- Session: Chief complaint, session notes
- Transcription: All transcript text
- Report: Generated content, manual corrections
- Bill: Financial amounts, insurance info, payment details

**Non-Encrypted Fields:**
- IDs, timestamps, status fields
- Configuration settings
- Search hashes (one-way hashing for searching encrypted data)

**Encryption Method:**
- Uses `EncryptedType` from SQLAlchemy
- Database-level encryption
- Keys managed separately (not in code)

---

### 5.2 Search on Encrypted Data

**Problem:** How to search encrypted patient names/phone/email?

**Solution:** **Hash-based searching**

1. When patient is created:
   - Encrypt PII fields (name, phone, email)
   - Generate SHA-256 hashes of searchable fields
   - Store hashes in indexed columns (`name_hash`, `phone_hash`, `email_hash`)

2. When searching:
   - Hash the search query
   - Search against hash columns
   - Retrieve matching records
   - Decrypt results for display

**Example:**
```python
# Creating patient
patient.first_name = encrypt("John")  # Encrypted
patient.last_name = encrypt("Doe")    # Encrypted
patient.name_hash = hash("john doe")  # Indexed for search

# Searching
search_hash = hash(user_query.lower())
results = db.query(Patient).filter(Patient.name_hash == search_hash)
# Decrypt results for display
```
