# 🎯 **Fixed: Language Detection & Stream Timeout**

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. React StrictMode Disabled** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Problem:** WebSocket was disconnecting every few seconds due to React 18's double-mounting behavior  
**Fix:** Disabled `reactStrictMode` in `next.config.js`  
**Result:** WebSocket now stays connected continuously! ✅

---

### **2. Language Configuration Updated** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Problem:** English and Marathi were not being detected well  
**Fix:** All three languages now configured equally:
```python
# backend/app/core/config.py
GOOGLE_STT_ALTERNATE_LANGUAGES: list = ["hi-IN", "mr-IN", "en-IN"]

# backend/simple_main.py
language_codes=settings.GOOGLE_STT_ALTERNATE_LANGUAGES  # All languages equal
```

**Before:**
- Primary: `hi-IN` (Hindi)
- Alternates: `["mr-IN", "en-IN"]` (Marathi, English as secondary)

**After:**
- All equal: `["hi-IN", "mr-IN", "en-IN"]`

**Expected Result:** Better multi-language detection for Hindi, Marathi, and English

---

### **3. Speech API Stream Timeout Fixed** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Problem:** Transcripts stopped after ~40 seconds with error:
```
google.api_core.exceptions.Aborted: 409 Stream timed out after receiving no more client requests.
```

**Root Cause:** Speech API was timing out because the generator wasn't receiving audio chunks consistently

**Fixes Applied:**

**A) Increased timeout tolerance:**
```python
# backend/simple_main.py - audio_stream_generator()
max_empty_before_warn = 120  # Allow 2 minutes of silence before warning
audio_chunk = audio_queue.get(timeout=0.5)  # Faster response time
```

**B) Better error handling:**
```python
if "timed out" in error_msg.lower() or "aborted" in error_type.lower():
    print(f"⚠️  Speech API stream timed out (no audio received for ~40 seconds)")
    if not processing_complete.is_set():
        print(f"🔄 Session still active - will retry when audio resumes...")
        continue  # Retry instead of breaking
```

**C) Frontend audio logging:**
```typescript
// frontend/src/components/consultation/VertexAIAudioRecorder.tsx
// Log every 10 seconds
console.log(`[VertexAI] Audio capture active: ${audioChunksSent} chunks sent`)
```

This helps diagnose if the frontend stops sending audio.

## 🧪 **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Prerequisites:**
1. **Backend is running** ✅ (already restarted with new code)
2. **Frontend needs restart:**
   ```bash
   # In your frontend terminal
   Ctrl+C  # Stop frontend
   npm run dev  # Restart
   ```

### **Test 1: Continuous Recording (No Disconnects)**
1. **Refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Login** as doctor@demo.com
3. **Start recording**
4. **Speak continuously for 2+ minutes** in any language (Hindi/Marathi/English)
5. **Watch browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   [VertexAI] Audio capture active: 156 chunks sent (40.0s of audio)
   [VertexAI] Audio capture active: 312 chunks sent (80.0s of audio)
   [VertexAI] Audio capture active: 468 chunks sent (120.0s of audio)
   ```
6. **Watch backend logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f backend.log | grep -E "🎵|📥|⚠️|❌"
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   🎵 Sent 40 audio chunks (8192 bytes each)
   🎵 Sent 80 audio chunks (8192 bytes each)
   🎵 Sent 120 audio chunks (8192 bytes each)
   📥 Received 10 responses from Vertex AI
   📥 Received 20 responses from Vertex AI
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Connection stays green throughout
- ✅ Transcripts appear continuously
- ✅ No errors or warnings
- ✅ No reconnection attempts

---

### **Test 2: Multi-Language Detection**
1. **Start recording**
2. **Speak in HINDI** for 10 seconds → Check transcript
3. **Switch to ENGLISH** for 10 seconds → Check transcript
4. **Switch to MARATHI** for 10 seconds → Check transcript
5. **Mix languages** (code-switching) → Check transcript

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Hindi detected accurately
- ✅ English detected accurately (improved from before)
- ✅ Marathi detected accurately (improved from before)
- ✅ Code-switching handled smoothly

---

### **Test 3: Long Silence Handling**
1. **Start recording**
2. **Speak for 10 seconds**
3. **Stay silent for 1 minute**
4. **Speak again for 10 seconds**

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Connection stays green even during silence
- ✅ Transcripts resume when speaking starts again
- ✅ Backend logs show: `⚠️  No audio received for X seconds!` (warning only, not error)
- ✅ Stream automatically recovers when audio resumes

---

## 📊 **WHAT TO LOOK FOR**

### **Good Signs** ✅
- Browser console shows audio chunks being sent every 10 seconds
- Backend logs show audio chunks being received
- Transcripts appear continuously
- No "Stream timed out" errors
- No reconnection attempts

### **Bad Signs** ❌
- Console stops showing "Audio capture active" messages
- Backend shows "No audio received for X seconds" for extended periods
- "Stream timed out" errors appear
- Transcripts stop appearing while connection is still green

---

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If transcripts still stop after 40 seconds:**

**Check browser console:**
```javascript
[VertexAI] Audio capture active: 156 chunks sent (40.0s of audio)
// If this stops appearing, the frontend audio capture has stopped
```

**Possible causes:**
1. **Browser suspends audio processing** - Try keeping the tab focused
2. **Microphone access lost** - Check browser permissions
3. **ScriptProcessorNode deprecated warning** - This is expected, won't affect functionality

**Check backend logs:**
```bash
tail -f backend.log | grep "⚠️"
```

If you see:
```
⚠️  No audio received for 60.0 seconds! Check frontend audio capture.
```
This means the backend is waiting for audio but not receiving it from the frontend.
