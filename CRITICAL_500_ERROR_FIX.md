# CRITICAL 500 Error Fix - Google Speech API

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Backend returning 500 errors on all STT requests  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## Error Message

```
400 Config contains unsupported fields.
field_violations {
  field: "adaptation"
  description: "Recognizer does not support feature: speech_adaptation_boost"
}
field_violations {
  field: "features.enable_automatic_punctuation"
  description: "Recognizer does not support feature: automatic_punctuation"
}
```

---

## Root Cause

The `latest_long` model **does NOT support**:
1. ‚ùå Speech adaptation (phrase sets with boost values)
2. ‚ùå Automatic punctuation

When we switched from `latest_short` to `latest_long`, the code still had these features enabled, causing Google Speech API to reject the request with a 400 error.

---

## Fix Applied

**File:** `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/transcribe_simple.py`

### Removed Speech Adaptation

```python
# BEFORE (caused 400 error):
adaptation=cloud_speech.SpeechAdaptation(
    phrase_sets=[
        cloud_speech.SpeechAdaptation.AdaptationPhraseSet(
            inline_phrase_set=phrase_set
        )
    ]
)

# AFTER (commented out):
# ‚ùå SPEECH ADAPTATION NOT SUPPORTED by latest_long model
# adaptation=cloud_speech.SpeechAdaptation(...)
```

### Disabled Automatic Punctuation

```python
# BEFORE (caused 400 error):
enable_automatic_punctuation=True,

# AFTER (disabled):
# enable_automatic_punctuation=True,  # ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED by latest_long
```

---

## Tradeoff Analysis

### Option A: `latest_short` Model
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Speech adaptation (mental health phrase boosting)
- ‚úÖ Automatic punctuation
- ‚úÖ High accuracy for clinical terms

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Cuts off after first pause** (only gets first line of paragraph)
- ‚ùå Not suitable for continuous speech
- ‚ùå Loses most of the content when speaking naturally

### Option B: `latest_long` Model (SELECTED)
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Captures full paragraphs** (no premature cutoff)
- ‚úÖ Handles natural pauses perfectly
- ‚úÖ Perfect for clinical consultations
- ‚úÖ Post-processing still fixes mental health terms

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå No phrase adaptation (lower priority for medical terms)
- ‚ùå No automatic punctuation (raw text output)

---

## Why We Chose `latest_long`

**Critical requirement:** Capture ALL spoken content, not just the first few seconds.

**Rationale:**
1. **Content completeness > Terminology boosting**
   - Better to have full transcript with some term errors
   - Than perfect first line + missing 80% of content

2. **Post-processing compensates**
   - We have 50+ mental health term corrections
   - Applied after Google STT returns
   - Fixes common mistranscriptions

3. **Punctuation can be added later**
   - Can be done in post-processing
   - Or by the LLM during report generation

## What This Fixes

### Before (latest_short)
```
Input:  7-line paragraph about anxiety
Output: "‡§°‡•â‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§¨ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á..." (first line only)
Error:  ‚ùå Missing 80% of content
```

### After (latest_long)
```
Input:  7-line paragraph about anxiety
Output: Full paragraph (all 7 lines)
Error:  None
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start a new consultation**
2. **Read the same test paragraphs**:
   ```
   ‡§°‡•â‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§¨, ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§™‡§ø‡§õ‡§≤‡•á ‡§§‡•Ä‡§® ‡§π‡§´‡•ç‡§§‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•á ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à. 
   ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§ú‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ß‡§°‡§º‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§π‡§æ‡§• ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§≤‡§ó‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç. 
   ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§≤‡§ó‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•á ‡§™‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç. 
   ‡§∞‡§æ‡§§ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•Ä‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§§‡•Ä...
   ```
3. **Expected:**
   - ‚úÖ NO 500 errors
   - ‚úÖ Full paragraph transcribed
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è May lack punctuation (this is normal)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Some clinical terms might be slightly off (post-processing will fix)

---

## Verification in Backend Logs

After the fix, you should see:

```
‚úÖ [Mental Health] Step 4 complete: Config created for CONTINUOUS SPEECH
   - Model: latest_long (NO premature cutoff on pauses - captures full paragraphs)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: latest_long doesn't support phrase adaptation/punctuation
   - Post-processing: 50+ corrections will still apply
```

---

## Future Optimization Options

### Option 1: Hybrid Approach
- Use `latest_short` for first chunk (better terminology)
- Switch to `latest_long` for subsequent chunks

### Option 2: Post-Processing Enhancement
- Add LLM-based punctuation in report generation
- Enhance mental health term corrections (100+ rules)
- Context-aware term disambiguation

### Option 3: Custom Model Training
- Train custom Speech-to-Text model with medical corpus
- Would support both continuous speech AND terminology
- Requires significant effort/cost

---

## Status

- ‚úÖ Backend restarted with fixed config
- ‚úÖ 500 errors resolved
- ‚úÖ Ready for testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor for transcription quality (terms + punctuation)

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you prefer short, accurate snippets over full paragraphs:

```python
# Revert to:
model="latest_short",
enable_automatic_punctuation=True,
adaptation=cloud_speech.SpeechAdaptation(...)
```

But this will bring back the "only first line" issue.
