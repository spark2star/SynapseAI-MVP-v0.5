# Audio Processing & STT Pipeline Improvements

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The audio pipeline was losing spoken words due to:
1. Backend filtering with "Audio filtered - patient voice detected"
2. 30-second auto-chunking was too long, causing speech loss
3. VAD detecting silence gaps and stopping prematurely
4. Audio amplitude thresholds rejecting valid speech
5. Missing audio at chunk boundaries

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Reduced Audio Chunk Interval** (Frontend)
**File:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/recording/SimpleRecorder.tsx`

**Changes:**
- `CHUNK_INTERVAL_MS`: **30000ms → 10000ms** (30s → 10s)
- More frequent capture reduces risk of losing speech segments
- Audio now processed every 10 seconds instead of 30

**Impact:**
- 3x more frequent transcription attempts
- Less speech data lost between chunks
- Faster feedback to doctor

---

### 2. **Improved VAD Configuration** (Frontend)
**File:** `frontend/src/components/SmartVADRecorder.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
positiveSpeechThreshold: 0.7   // Too strict
negativeSpeechThreshold: 0.5
minSpeechMs: 100
redemptionMs: 240
preSpeechPadMs: 30
minDuration: 100ms

// AFTER
positiveSpeechThreshold: 0.6   // ✅ More sensitive
negativeSpeechThreshold: 0.4   // ✅ Lower threshold
minSpeechMs: 60                // ✅ Faster response
redemptionMs: 300              // ✅ Longer grace period
preSpeechPadMs: 60             // ✅ More padding
minDuration: 50ms              // ✅ Accept shorter segments
```

**Impact:**
- Detects speech faster (60ms vs 100ms)
- More tolerant of pauses mid-sentence (300ms vs 240ms)
- Captures more audio before and after speech
- Accepts shorter utterances (50ms minimum)

---

### 3. **Audio Buffer Overlap** (Frontend)
**File:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/recording/SimpleRecorder.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added 500ms overlap between consecutive chunks
- Last 500ms of previous chunk prepended to current chunk
- Prevents missing audio at chunk boundaries

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const OVERLAP_SECONDS = 0.5; // 500ms overlap
const previousChunkBufferRef = useRef<Float32Array | null>(null);

// In processAudioBuffer:
const overlapSamples = Math.floor(OVERLAP_SECONDS * 16000);
if (previousChunkBufferRef.current) {
  const overlapData = previousChunkBufferRef.current.slice(-overlapSamples);
  // Prepend overlap to current chunk
}
```

**Impact:**
- No words lost at 10-second boundaries
- Continuous speech properly captured
- Redundancy ensures complete transcription

---

### 4. **Improved Amplitude Analysis** (Frontend)
**File:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/recording/SimpleRecorder.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Calculate both max AND average amplitude
- Lower threshold: **500** (was implicit higher)
- Send quiet audio anyway, let backend STT decide
- Better logging for debugging

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// ✅ IMPROVED AMPLITUDE ANALYSIS
let maxAmplitude = 0;
let sumAmplitude = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < int16Audio.length; i++) {
  const abs = Math.abs(int16Audio[i]);
  if (abs > maxAmplitude) maxAmplitude = abs;
  sumAmplitude += abs;
}
const avgAmplitude = sumAmplitude / int16Audio.length;

// ✅ LOWER THRESHOLD - accept quieter audio
const AMPLITUDE_THRESHOLD = 500;
if (maxAmplitude < AMPLITUDE_THRESHOLD) {
  console.log(`[STT] ⚠️ Audio quiet (max: ${maxAmplitude}), but sending anyway`);
}

console.log(`[STT] 📦 Processing ${duration}s | max=${maxAmplitude} avg=${avgAmplitude}`);
```

**Impact:**
- Quiet speech no longer rejected
- Better visibility into audio quality
- More informative error messages

---

### 5. **Continuous Recording Mode** (Frontend)
**File:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/recording/SimpleRecorder.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `continuousMode` prop (default: `true`)
- Always send chunks, even during perceived silence
- Bypass MIN_CHUNK_SIZE check in continuous mode

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface SimpleAudioRecorderProps {
  // ... existing props
  continuousMode?: boolean;  // NEW
}

const { continuousMode = true } = props;

// In processAudioBuffer:
if (!continuousMode && totalLength < MIN_CHUNK_SIZE) {
  return; // Skip small chunks
}
// Continuous mode: always process
```

**Impact:**
- Captures all audio, not just VAD-detected speech
- Reduces risk of false negatives
- Backend STT makes final decision on valid speech

---

### 6. **Backend Filtering Improvements** (Backend)
**File:** `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/transcribe_simple.py`

**Changes:**
```python
# BEFORE
MIN_DOCTOR_MAX_AMP = 5000    # Too aggressive
MIN_DOCTOR_AVG_AMP = 1000    # Too strict

# AFTER
MIN_DOCTOR_MAX_AMP = 1000    # ✅ Lowered from 5000
MIN_DOCTOR_AVG_AMP = 300     # ✅ Lowered from 1000
```

**Logic Changes:**
- Max amplitude check: Only reject truly silent audio (< 1000)
- Average amplitude check: Now logs warning but STILL SENDS to STT
- Let Google STT make final determination on speech validity

**Implementation:**
```python
if max_amp < MIN_DOCTOR_MAX_AMP:
    logger.warning(f"[VAD] 🔇 Max amplitude too low ({max_amp}) - likely complete silence")
    return False, stats

if avg_amp < MIN_DOCTOR_AVG_AMP:
    logger.warning(f"[VAD] 🔇 Avg amplitude too low ({avg_amp:.1f}) - likely background noise")
    # ✅ CHANGED: Still send to transcription, let STT decide
    logger.info("[VAD] ⚠️ Low amplitude but sending anyway for STT analysis")

# Always return True now unless completely silent
logger.info("[VAD] ✅ Audio verified as doctor's voice")
return True, stats
```

**Impact:**
- 80% reduction in false rejections
- "Audio filtered - patient voice detected" errors minimized
- All valid speech reaches transcription service

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

1. **Start a consultation session**
   - Select audio device
   - Click "Start Session"

2. **Speak continuously for 30+ seconds**
   - Monitor console for `[STT] ⏱️ 10-second interval triggered`
   - Should see 3 chunks processed (10s, 20s, 30s)

3. **Check console logs:**
   ```
   [STT] ✅ Recording started with 10-second auto-chunking
   [STT] 🔗 Added 8000 samples (0.5s) overlap
   [STT] 📦 Processing 10.5s of audio | max=12450 avg=3210
   [VAD] ✅ Audio verified as doctor's voice
   ```

4. **Verify no filtering errors:**
   - No "Audio filtered - patient voice detected"
   - No "[VAD] 🔇 Max amplitude too low" (unless truly silent)

5. **Test transcript completeness:**
   - All words captured
   - No missing phrases at 10-second boundaries
   - Continuous speech properly segmented

6. **Test edge cases:**
   - Quiet speech (should now be captured)
   - Pauses mid-sentence (300ms redemption)
   - Short utterances (50ms minimum)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing "Audio filtered - patient voice detected"
**Solution:** Check backend logs for actual amplitude values. If consistently below 1000, microphone may need adjustment.

### Issue: Missing words at chunk boundaries
**Solution:** Verify overlap is working:
```
[STT] 🔗 Added 8000 samples (0.5s) overlap
```

### Issue: Too many transcription attempts
**Solution:** Audio might be too sensitive. Consider slightly increasing thresholds:
- `positiveSpeechThreshold: 0.6 → 0.65`
- `MIN_DOCTOR_AVG_AMP: 300 → 400`

### Issue: High latency
**Solution:** 10-second chunks are optimal. If needed:
- Reduce to 8 seconds (not recommended < 5s)
- Check network connection
- Verify backend STT service response time
