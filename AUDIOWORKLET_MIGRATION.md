# 🎯 **AudioWorklet Migration - Fix 40-Second Timeout**

## ✅ **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **Problem:**
Frontend audio capture was stopping after ~40 seconds, causing transcripts to stop appearing even though the WebSocket connection remained active.

### **Root Cause:**
`ScriptProcessorNode` (deprecated) was being paused/stopped by browsers after ~40 seconds:
- Deprecated API since 2014
- Browsers actively throttle it or stop it entirely
- Runs on main thread, subject to browser tab management
- Chrome shows warning: `[Deprecation] The ScriptProcessorNode is deprecated. Use AudioWorkletNode instead.`

### **Solution:**
Migrated to modern `AudioWorkletNode`:
- **Runs in separate audio thread** (not affected by tab focus)
- **No browser throttling** - guaranteed real-time processing
- **Modern, supported API** - future-proof
- **Better performance** - doesn't block main thread

---

## 📝 **CHANGES MADE**

### **1. Created AudioWorklet Processor**
**File:** `frontend/public/audio-processor.worklet.js`

This is a separate JavaScript file that runs in the audio worklet thread:
- Converts Float32 audio to Int16 (LINEAR16 format)
- Sends processed audio to main thread via `postMessage`
- Logs progress every 10 seconds
- Runs continuously without browser interruption

### **2. Updated VertexAIAudioRecorder Component**
**File:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/VertexAIAudioRecorder.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced `audioProcessorRef` (ScriptProcessorNode) with `audioWorkletNodeRef` (AudioWorkletNode)
- ✅ Added AudioWorklet module loading with error handling
- ✅ Implemented message handler for audio data from worklet
- ✅ Updated cleanup to properly disconnect AudioWorkletNode
- ✅ Removed deprecated `ScriptProcessorNode` code entirely

**Before:**
```typescript
// OLD: Deprecated ScriptProcessorNode
const processor = audioContext.createScriptProcessor(4096, 1, 1)
processor.onaudioprocess = (e) => {
    // Process audio on main thread
    // ❌ Subject to browser throttling
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// NEW: Modern AudioWorkletNode
await audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule('/audio-processor.worklet.js')
const workletNode = new AudioWorkletNode(audioContext, 'audio-capture-processor')
workletNode.port.onmessage = (event) => {
    // Receive processed audio from separate thread
    // ✅ Runs continuously, no throttling
}
```

## 🧪 **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Restart Frontend**
The worklet file needs to be served by the Next.js server:
```bash
# In your frontend terminal
Ctrl+C  # Stop frontend
npm run dev  # Restart
```

### **Step 2: Clear Browser Cache**
AudioWorklet files are cached aggressively:
```
Cmd+Shift+R  # Hard refresh (Mac)
Ctrl+Shift+R  # Hard refresh (Windows/Linux)
```

Or:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### **Step 3: Test Continuous Recording**

**Test Case 1: Long Recording**
1. Login and start recording
2. **Speak continuously for 2-3 minutes**
3. Watch browser console for:
   ```javascript
   [VertexAI] AudioWorklet module loaded successfully
   [VertexAI] AudioWorkletNode started @ 16kHz (modern, reliable API)
   [VertexAI] ✅ No more 40-second timeouts - AudioWorklet runs in separate thread
   [VertexAI] AudioWorklet: 1250 chunks processed (10.0s of audio)
   [VertexAI] AudioWorklet: 2500 chunks processed (20.0s of audio)
   [VertexAI] AudioWorklet: 3750 chunks processed (30.0s of audio)
   [VertexAI] AudioWorklet: 5000 chunks processed (40.0s of audio)  ← Should continue past 40s!
   [VertexAI] AudioWorklet: 6250 chunks processed (50.0s of audio)
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Transcripts appear continuously beyond 40 seconds
- ✅ No timeout errors
- ✅ Audio chunks keep sending indefinitely

**Test Case 2: Background Tab**
1. Start recording
2. **Switch to a different browser tab**
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. **Switch back**

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Recording continues (AudioWorklet runs in separate thread)
- ✅ Transcripts accumulated during background time
- ✅ No interruption

**Test Case 3: Long Silence**
1. Start recording
2. Speak for 10 seconds
3. **Stay silent for 2 minutes**
4. Speak again

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Audio keeps streaming (even during silence)
- ✅ Backend shows warnings but doesn't disconnect
- ✅ Transcripts resume when speaking starts

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue 1: "Failed to initialize audio processor"**
**Cause:** AudioWorklet file not found or failed to load

**Solutions:**
1. **Check file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls frontend/public/audio-processor.worklet.js
   ```
   Should show the file.

2. **Hard refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)

3. **Check browser console** for exact error:
   ```javascript
   Failed to load AudioWorklet: ...
   ```

4. **Verify Next.js is serving static files:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/audio-processor.worklet.js
   ```
   Should download the file (not 404).

---

### **Issue 2: "AudioWorkletNode is not defined"**
**Cause:** Browser doesn't support AudioWorklet (very old browser)

**Solutions:**
1. **Update browser** to latest version
2. **Supported browsers:**
   - Chrome 66+ (2018)
   - Firefox 76+ (2020)
   - Safari 14.1+ (2021)
   - Edge 79+ (2020)

---

### **Issue 3: Still stops after 40 seconds**
**Cause:** Old code still running (cache not cleared)

**Solutions:**
1. **Hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache completely:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
3. **Check console logs** - should see:
   ```javascript
   [VertexAI] AudioWorkletNode started @ 16kHz (modern, reliable API)
   ```
   If you see `ScriptProcessorNode` instead, old code is still running.
