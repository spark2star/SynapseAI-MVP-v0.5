# Language Selection Feature - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented a language selection feature that allows doctors to choose the primary language (Hindi, Marathi, or English) before starting a consultation session. This improves STT transcription accuracy by providing explicit language context to the speech recognition service.

---

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Created LanguageSelector Component ‚úÖ

**File:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/LanguageSelector.tsx` (NEW)

- Dropdown UI component similar to AudioDeviceSelector
- Three language options with native script display:
  - Hindi (‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä) - `hi-IN`
  - Marathi (‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä) - `mr-IN`
  - English (India) - `en-IN`
- No default selection - shows "Select primary language" placeholder
- Visual feedback when language is selected
- Props: `onLanguageChange`, `selectedLanguage`

**Key Features:**
- Clean, accessible dropdown interface
- Language names displayed in both English and native script
- Visual indicator showing selected language
- Confirmation message when language is selected

---

### 2. Updated Patient Detail Page ‚úÖ

**File:** `frontend/src/app/dashboard/patients/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Import Added (Line 33):**
   ```typescript
   import LanguageSelector from '@/components/consultation/LanguageSelector'
   ```

2. **State Added (Line 102):**
   ```typescript
   const [selectedLanguage, setSelectedLanguage] = useState<string>('')
   ```

3. **Validation Added (Lines 282-286):**
   ```typescript
   // CHECK LANGUAGE SELECTION
   if (!selectedLanguage) {
       toast.error('Please select the primary language for consultation')
       return
   }
   ```

4. **Language Selector Added to Form (Lines 872-875):**
   ```tsx
   <LanguageSelector
       selectedLanguage={selectedLanguage}
       onLanguageChange={setSelectedLanguage}
   />
   ```

5. **Button Validation Updated (Line 880):**
   ```typescript
   disabled={!chiefComplaint.trim() || !selectedAudioDevice || !selectedLanguage}
   ```

6. **Language Passed to SimpleRecorder (Line 974):**
   ```typescript
   selectedLanguage={selectedLanguage}
   ```

---

### 3. Updated SimpleRecorder Component ‚úÖ

**File:** `frontend/src/components/consultation/recording/SimpleRecorder.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Interface Updated (Line 17):**
   ```typescript
   interface SimpleAudioRecorderProps {
       // ... existing props
       selectedLanguage?: string
       // ... other props
   }
   ```

2. **Props Destructuring Updated (Line 72):**
   ```typescript
   const SimpleAudioRecorder: React.FC<SimpleAudioRecorderProps> = memo(({
       sessionId,
       // ... existing props
       selectedLanguage,
       // ... other props
   }) => {
   ```

3. **FormData Updated with User Selection (Lines 157-161):**
   ```typescript
   // CRITICAL FIX: Add language parameter from user selection
   formData.append('language', selectedLanguage || 'hi-IN');
   formData.append('context', 'mental_health');
   
   console.log(`[STT] üì§ Sending audio (attempt ${attempt + 1}/${retriesLeft + 1})...`);
   console.log(`[STT] üó£Ô∏è Language: ${selectedLanguage || 'hi-IN'} (User selected)`);
   ```

---

### 4. Updated Backend STT Service ‚úÖ

**File:** `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/transcribe_simple.py`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added Language Parameter (Line 412):**
   ```python
   @router.post("/chunk")
   async def transcribe_audio_chunk(
       session_id: str = Query(...),
       audio: UploadFile = File(...),
       language: str = Query(default='hi-IN'),  # NEW
       db: Session = Depends(get_db),
       current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
   ):
   ```

2. **Dynamic Language Prioritization (Lines 699-708):**
   ```python
   # Dynamic language priority based on user selection
   user_language = language  # From Query parameter
   all_languages = ["hi-IN", "mr-IN", "en-IN"]
   # Put user's selected language first, then add others for code-mixing support
   language_codes = [user_language]
   other_languages = [lang for lang in all_languages if lang != user_language]
   language_codes.extend(other_languages[:2])  # Add 2 alternates for code-mixing
   
   logger.info(f"üó£Ô∏è [STT] User selected language: {user_language}")
   logger.info(f"üó£Ô∏è [STT] Language priority: {language_codes}")
   ```

3. **Config Updated (Line 717):**
   ```python
   config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
       # ... existing config
       language_codes=language_codes,  # Dynamic based on user selection
       # ... rest of config
   )
   ```

4. **Logging Updated (Lines 734-737):**
   ```python
   logger.info(f"‚úÖ [Mental Health] Step 4 complete: Config created with COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRIC context")
   logger.info(f"   - Model: latest_short (optimized for therapeutic conversations with emotional speech)")
   logger.info(f"   - Languages: {language_codes} (User-selected: {user_language} is PRIMARY)")
   logger.info(f"   - üîß Dynamic language prioritization based on user selection")
   ```

---

## User Experience Flow

1. **Doctor navigates to patient detail page**
2. **Starts new consultation:**
   - Enters chief complaint
   - Selects audio input device (microphone)
   - **NEW: Selects primary language** (Hindi/Marathi/English)
3. **System validates all selections before allowing session start**
4. **"Start Session" button remains disabled until:**
   - Chief complaint is entered
   - Audio device is selected
   - **Language is selected**
5. **Once recording starts:**
   - Selected language is sent with every audio chunk
   - Backend prioritizes the selected language for STT
   - Other languages remain available for code-mixing support
6. **Language selection does not persist** (resets on page reload)

## Technical Details

### Frontend Architecture

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
PatientDetailPage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LanguageSelector (NEW)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dropdown with 3 language options
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Visual confirmation indicator
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SimpleRecorder
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sends selectedLanguage to backend
```

**State Management:**

- No localStorage or persistence
- Fresh selection required for each page visit

### Backend Architecture

**STT Language Priority:**
```python
# Example: User selects Marathi
user_language = "mr-IN"
language_codes = ["mr-IN", "hi-IN", "en-IN"]  # Marathi first

# Example: User selects Hindi
user_language = "hi-IN"
language_codes = ["hi-IN", "mr-IN", "en-IN"]  # Hindi first

# Example: User selects English
user_language = "en-IN"
language_codes = ["en-IN", "hi-IN", "mr-IN"]  # English first
```

**Benefits:**
- Primary language gets highest recognition priority
- Code-mixing support maintained with alternate languages
- Optimal transcription accuracy for user's chosen language

## Benefits of This Implementation

### 1. Improved STT Accuracy
- User explicitly selects the primary language
- Backend prioritizes selected language in recognition
- Reduces language misdetection issues

### 2. Better User Control
- Doctors choose based on patient's language
- No guessing or auto-detection errors
- Clear, intentional language selection

### 3. Code-Mixing Support Maintained
- Primary language gets priority
- Other languages still available as alternates
- Handles natural code-switching in conversations

### 4. Flexibility
- No persistence means fresh choice each time
- Can select different language per session
- Adapts to different patient needs

### 5. Clear Feedback
- Visual confirmation of selection
- Console logs show selected language
- Backend logs verify correct language used

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Persistence:** Language selection resets on page reload
   - **Rationale:** Per user request, no saving for now
   - **Future Enhancement:** Could add localStorage or user profile setting

2. **No Auto-Detection:** User must always select
   - **Rationale:** Ensures explicit, intentional choice
   - **Future Enhancement:** Could add smart defaults based on previous sessions

3. **No Mid-Session Change:** Cannot change language during recording
   - **Rationale:** Would require session restart
   - **Future Enhancement:** Could allow language switching between chunks

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

### Optional Phase 2 Features:
1. **Remember Last Used Language**
   - Save to localStorage
   - Auto-select on next visit
   - Still allow changing

2. **Patient-Level Default**
   - Save preferred language in patient profile
   - Auto-select when viewing that patient
   - Override available

3. **Smart Suggestions**
   - Analyze previous session transcripts
   - Suggest most commonly used language
   - Learn from usage patterns

4. **Mid-Session Language Switch**
   - Allow changing language during consultation
   - Useful for multilingual sessions
   - Requires chunk-level language handling

5. **Language Statistics**
   - Track language usage per doctor
   - Show most common language
   - Analytics dashboard

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Language selector not appearing
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and refresh page

### Issue: Button still disabled after selecting language
**Check:**
- Chief complaint is entered
- Audio device is selected
- Language is actually selected (not just dropdown opened)

### Issue: Wrong language in backend logs
**Check:**
- Browser console shows correct language being sent
- FormData includes correct language parameter
- Network tab shows language in request

### Issue: Language not improving transcription
**Check:**
- Backend logs show correct language priority
- STT service is using the language parameter
- Audio quality is adequate
